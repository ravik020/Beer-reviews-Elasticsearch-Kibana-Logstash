7.7,64883,1075,Cauldron DIPA,American Double / Imperial IPA,4,4.5,4,4,johnmichaelsen,4.5,"According to the website, the style for the Caldera Cauldron changes every year. The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday. The beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.",1293735206

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy yellow/orange color with a half finger of fluffy white head. The head fades to a small layer on top of the pour. Smell: Very light and crisp. I'm definitely picking up the ginger, but it's not overly powerful. There is a slight sweetness from the malt as well. Taste: Very light and refreshing. The ginger shows up right away and then fades towards the finish of the sip. The finish is malty and bread like. Mouthfeel: The body is on the thin side with smooth carbonation and a very dry finish. Overall: This is a light and refreshing beer, but nothing spectacular. The amount of ginger is nice, but I would have liked to have more going on.",1325524659

Pours a bud light yellow with a tiny white head of small bubbles. The beer is almost as clear as a glass of water with some food coloring in it. Aroma of light ginger, a very light malt aroma but primarily odorless on the malt side. I wouldn't be completely surprised if there were some adjuncts in here because of the lack of underlying malt flavors. Taste is of a light adjunct lager with a dosing of ginger. Not surprising there. This is a light session beer, good for the warmer days of spring / summer. Mouthfeel is extremely light, high carbonation. Overall decent. This would be great if you were drinking beers on draft at the bar with some friends just hanging out. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out though to drink out of a bottle.",1306276018

I like ginger, and it was reasonably cheap compared to the other beers I was looking at. Pours a pale golden color with smallish head. Nose is largely uneventful, some ginger in there, a bit of pear, but mainly normal lager. Taste is pretty good, bringing a bit more of the ginger to the fore. MF was a bit fizzy, not terrible though. Easy drinker, I had no problem finishing the bomber. Interesting, but I probably won't get it again.",1290454503

Hazy titanium yellow body (which catches the shadows forming a beautiful mysterious gradient) with an incredibly dense pillow of magnolia cream. Heavy persistent head and rich creamy lacing. Pale malt, asian pear, and a hint of citrus in the nose. A vaguely tropical lager... Tastes very much like a well done APA, with a nice balance of pale malt and low hop bitterness. The ginger adds to the refreshing character, but isn't readily detectable at first (lacks any ""bite""). Medium-dry finish - very clean and extremely quaffable. I can imagine hibiscus and beets working in small quantities, though I think they omitted those for this version... Light bodied, pillowy, smooth and moderately carbonated. Don't go into this expecting a ginger beer (despite its name) as it has little in common with that spicy soft drink. This is a wonderful session ale though, and worth seeking out if you are a fan of light yet flavorful lagers. Would obviously go perfectly with sushi.",1285632924
4.7,52159,1075,Caldera Ginger Beer,Herbed / Spiced Beer,4,5,5,4,MadeInOregon,4,"OK, so the only reason I bought this while shopping at Whole Foods was because I've never had a ""ginger beer"" unless it was ginger ALE...and we all know that's not the kind of ""beer"" we're interested in on this site! I was very excited to try this one!... When poured out it looks like a cheapo macro lager at first sight, then the slowly fading head suggests otherwise. The body is crystal clear and is a very light straw color. The head is bright white and slowly dissipates, but is initially quite thick. Smell is adjuncty, but there are slight notes of honey and some kind of herby thing going on...ginger perhaps? Can't really tell. From the smell there is obviously something different about this beer though. It has a unique spicy smell to it and reminds me a lot of basil, not ginger. I really can't quite place everything that I smell, but it is a very nice aroma. Superb fragrance for this beer, though definitely not a ""ginger beer"" based on the smell. The taste is very unique also. It's kind of like a spiced pilsner or kolsch but the ""spice"" is kind of hard to identify. It does not taste like ginger. This beer actually reminds me a lot of Bison's Honey Basil ale. There is some definite astringent burn in the upper throat after swallowing that is no doubt from the ginger, but that is the only ginger I can detect with any certainty. It is only slightly hoppy and malty. This a very enjoyable, very drinkable beer (I could easily drink 2 22oz'ers) but I think it's failing in its claim to be a ""ginger"" beer because I don't smell it, can barely taste it, and can only really detect the ginger's physiological effects of a warm throat and stomach. So, rating this one is hard; I've never had a ginger beer so I don't really know what one ought to taste like...but then again I can't really tell if I'm tasting ginger here or the combination of other things. So confused. My recommendation to you Caldera folks: ADD MORE GINGER! There's obviously enough of a curiosity about this style to not hurt sales if it was strengthened. I for one could handle it.",1283154365

Almost cake-like in its malt aroma, sharply bready with a slight edge of sweetness T: Nice clear malty throat taste, reminds me of strands of complex sugars and grains, ginger is more subtle than I expected, more of an undertone than a backbone M: A refreshing light beer feel, like a pilsner or summer ale D: If this was a sixer instead of a double-deuce, I could see this being a fine picnic pounder Overall, pretty impressed for the particular style",1277557990

S: Great nose of ginger, honey, perfume. T: Rather light upfront, it reminds me of Lawnmower, with a hint of ale fruitiness/Kolsch-like almost. Good ginger honey notes on the back end, not taking over the beer in any way. The ginger flavour is clear, but I wanted it to come out a little more in the end. M: Very light-bodied, watery, light base beer for sure. D: An easy drinking spiced beer, this will offend no one, but there's not a complexity to this brew at all.",1275779250

I bought it cause it's the only bottle of Caldera I've ever seen, so I guess so. Stoked to be the first to review a beer! That's a lot of responsibility so I might as well give it a thorough review. Poured into my New Belgium Tulip. A - Clear golden color with a bright white 1"" head that slowly fades to a ring around the top. Lacing is minimal, but still there and fighting to cling to the glass S - Smell is of ginger and honey. Very appealing. T - First hit is of ginger. Not too strong or biting but just the right amount. Fades to a sweetness on the tongue that is sort of perfect and then... a little bit of bite from the hops making their presence known. M - Medium bodied and full. A nice round beer for the summer. Not too heavy, definately not watery. Not very good at describing it other than it's good. D - I really like this beer and I could probably put 2 or 3 glasses away, so one bomber is enough for me. I think 2 bombers would be too much, but I could probably drink one and half, so I think I'll have to stick with the one. Overall this is a pretty good ginger beer. I think that for my money though, I'd rather buy Trade Route's Ginger Pale Ale. If you've never had a ginger beer, Pick it up.",1273109020

Same with the taste, lacking flavor, complexity, just went with smoothness. No off flavors though, so I can't say this is bad, just unadventurous, especially for Caldera, whom I think is generally underrated. You really have to search to pull anything out of this in terms of the usual chocolate/coffee flavors, really, the only thing I can tell is that the oats did their job, because this is smooth and unoffensive.

7.2,10789,1075,Caldera Oatmeal Stout,Oatmeal Stout,2.5,1.5,2,2.5,RedDiamond,2,"Caldera presents yet another circumstance where the brewery does not operate a brewpub, doesnt bottle their beers, and is located 300 miles from my home. To review their beers I traveled to their hometown of Ashland, OR and drank at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. This may have been a mistake. Though I had other reasons to visit Ashland, its disappointing (to say the least) to travel 300 miles and be served a spoiled beer. Both the Oatmeal Stout and Ashland Amber were of poor quality at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. In the case of the Oatmeal Stout, a nice measure of cream and a wayward thread of mint were marred by a sulfuric smell and likely bacterial infection. Though I cant say for certain, my best guess is that the house tap lines were something other than sanitized. I will attempt to revisit and re-evaluate this beer. But for the time being, its important to ask a pertinent question about quality control. Caldera is a 10 bbl microbrewery in a small town. How much responsibility do they have towards assuring that taps serving their product in their hometown are kept reasonably clean and free of bacterial encroachment? My answer to this question is that the brewery does have some responsibility to assure quality pours in its own hometown. This is especially so when they operate no pub of their own. Not only does this effort protect the consumer from being served a spoiled beer, but the enforcement of quality control measures at the point of consumption simply makes good business sense. Till then, theres nothing I really care say about this beer other than to wish whoever pursues it greater luck than I had at Ashland Creek.",1103502339

Sweet caramel malts surprise me as I thought the smoke would hit hard right off the bat... The smokiness here is beautifully done...

And I dunno if it's just me and my mental associations, but I could swear I smelled the BBQ sauce in this too. The palate, much like the nose, is hugely smoky- more bbq and toffee flavors- with a medium-body and a slight creaminess from the malt. The hoppiness is mild while the smoke, naturally, is what lingers on the nice finish. A wonderful effort overall.

I'll leave it at that and hope I don't O.D. off this 22 ounce bottle. On to the beer: The chestnut colored body is a looker in the stange glass. On top, the head has a beige color, a somewhat creamy texture, several groupings of lace sticking around and retention. The rauch part is done extremely well; mouth-watering jerkied meats stand out above with a little sweetness and a kiss of leafy hop. There's a lot of meat on the bones of this beer. Loads and loads and maltiness and medium smokiness make this a winner. The two run in sperate stages and never cross into each other's territory, which in this case I adore. Its got the smokiness that I would find in a summer sausage. On the malty side, there's loads of caramel. Little notes of ash give me the impression that I'm at a campfire. Hints of brown sugar. Alcohol slowly gets noticed, but in a good way; here it brings notes of raisin. There is a moderate hoppiness that can be sensed for a brief second, catch it before the smoke and malt beat it down. On the fuller side in terms of mouthfeel, quite smooth with the bubbles very small yet enough to be felt. If I hadn't stuffed myself with Chinese food earlier in the night, I may have been more tempted to overdose on Rauch Ur Bock. Only kidding, I have a good idea when to stop. Warning, you may be temped buy more bottles after you try your first. In short, superb.",1306128988

A touch of lemon and citrus fruitiness in the finish which blends perfectly with the cherry smoke. It's not as crisp or dry as other Rachbiers, and it seems a bit more full-bodied, with almost a touch of syrupiness to it. which is kind of an interesting take on it. I'm digging it. I'm not usually one to say this, but it's almost a touch malt-forward. Not that it's a bad thing.

Smell is smokey and sweet. Both cherry and beechwood were used, but I'm getting mostly cherry in the nose. Taste is really quite smokey, the beechwood really asserting itself here, although the sweetness of the cherry wood and the malt is no slouch either. The smoke has a sharp phenolic quality that I get from peat, but with the sweetness I think it works well. Note it's not cloying, the sweetness is enjoyable and provides relative balance. Mouthfeel is slick, some softness, a medium bodied, and smooth. Nice. Drinkability is really quite good for such a smoke bomb. No doubt inspired by Aecht Schlenkerla, with the body and color of the marzen, but the punch of the ur bock, it one of the best stateside examples of the style, which is rarely attempted and even more rarely successful.

If I had to reach for some balance there is a faint raisin type sweetness buried in the finish. Notes: I'd be interested to see exactly how they brewed this beer.

Sweet stone fruits and a touch of orange zest add their nuances to the flavor. Its more complex than I usually find smoked beers to be and I can really enjoy it!

It's not overly smoky, which is a positive thing in that it allows some of the other delicate scents and flavours to shine. Of those, I pick up on a light - but noticeable - fruitiness, both in nose and on the palate that seems a little odd. worth note: after writing the above, I noticed the print on the side of the bottle to see that cherry wood is used in addition to beechwood. That would explain the fruitiness noted. M + D: Body feels a little lighter in the mouthfeel, but seems to pick up a little weight after going down, however little sense that might make.

Earthy and slightly piney with bitter sappy sugar.. The bittering is not high, but there is little aroma hopping evident or much malt complexity either. This is a very light pale ale with little going on beyond some bittering hops, leaving a slightly floral but vegetal finish. An okay beer for a local brewpub, but not quite up to the standard of most pale ales in distribution. Light bodied, creamy, lots of smooth bubbles. A simple beer, but not really in a good way.

Retention is amazing, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. The nose is just bursting with hoppy cascade aroma's!! Sweet fruits, musty herbs, wheat and corn and light but sweet malt. This all cascade beauty has a great aroma. The hoppy flavor's here are deep and very complex, cascade hoppiness all in my face. Light and very, very crispy feel is exciting and spot-on for the style. crisp with a creamy smooth finish from the beastie foam still clumping it's way down slow. The cascade hops provide a gentle fruitiness and perfect dry-herbal and earthy complexity. I havn't been this excited for a Pale ale since my very first Sierra Nevada!!(circa 1996) This pale ale in a can has made my day, and I'm camping in one of the most pristine locations I've ever been too.

Pretty good retention and lacing. Fairly strong citrusy hop bouquet with a pleasant mild sweetness and biscuity malt. Smells like it will be a crisp, dry brew. And so it proves to be. There's a bit of honeyish sweetness up front, but it's immediately bullied around by a tag team of citrus (orange zest and grapefruit) and sharp pine needle flavors. There's a bit of earthiness in there, too. The sweetness dries up torward the finish as the citrus is joined by some pine needles for a sharp sting of bitterness and a rather 'scratchy' mouthfeel. After a couple of seconds, the bitterness is chased away by a crisp snap of biscuity malt. Carbonation is lively, and the beer starts off as seemingly medium-bodied, but 'fluffs up' in to something pretty substantial. Overall impression: Excellent APA.

Poured into a traditional American pint glass that came chilled, so I had to give it a chance to warm and wipe it down. Appearance: Pours a surprisingly light and transparent golden yellow - I'm hesitant to say urine, but, you know - with an initially foamy two-finger head that fades into a relatively healthy sheen pretty quickly and leaves lots of scraggly, fluffy, cloud-like lacing streaming upwards towards the rim. The collar if thick and fluffy, though light looking. A solid start. Aroma: Buttery, slightly spicy malt notes, cracker and biscuit-like, with a few light fruity esters - perhaps hoppy in origin, perhaps yeasty in origin, coming across as pineapple in places - mingling with some heavier, definitively hoppy citrus notes, and plenty of grassy, spicy notes. Perfectly pleasant. Taste: Very balanced for a pale ale, almost ESB like. The malt profile here is large and in charge, very graham cracker/biscuit like, perhaps slightly buttery in places. Malt bitterness is mild to perhaps moderate, slightly herbal and grassy, lacking a lot of those good west coast hop notes that I'd like out of, well, a west coast hopped ale. It's almost cinnamony in places, probably a result of the hop notes. Odd but interesting. Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth and soft, gently carbonated, leading to a very creamy and subtle mouthfeel, a feel which works well with the malt profile on this one. Very very nice. Drinkability: This was a strange and somewhat unexpected brew. Not quite your traditional west coast pale ale, heavy on the bitterness, citrus, and minty hops with a heavily roasted but still sweet malt backbone to back it up; this one is more heavy on lighter, spicier, grassy hop notes and has a surprisingly light and dry malt foundation.

Not a world beater, but a pretty good example of an American pale ale. Not quite good enough for me to shift from my stand-bys for the style, but if this is what's available, I wouldn't shy away from it.",1215478984

Very nice floral hop aroma. Lots of cascade with the underlying citrus aroma. Nice little caramel malt aroma but it is definitely hop dominant. Golden but cloudy. Pours with a thick pure white head that ends up as a half inch layer of rocky bubbles. Just a little bit of rising bubbles in the glass. Pretty good lacing. Nice caramel malt flavor right off and then it has a good hop bitter bite. Mostly grapefruit citrus hops. Can says that it is all cascade so that makes sense. Finish is also some caramel malt flavor. In between there is some oily hop flavor too. Pretty much exactly what I'm looking for in a west coast PA. Hoppy but with enough malt that it isn't unbalanced. Medium bodied with a good medium carbonation level. Not heavy at all. very nice on my palate. Very nice beer. I wouldn't rave about to my beer geek friends it but I would be happy to have it as a regular in my fridge. Solid everyday drinking type beer.,1215388875

At first glance this beer is a bit lighter than Dale's but remains a very good looking beverage, pouring a slightly hazed golden color with a large white head that lasts a while and leaves very impressive lacing. Nose is very hoppy and bitter, quite a bit of citrus noticeable. More sweet and less toasted malt than the Dale's. I'd have a hard time deciding on a favorite between the appearance and aroma, but very slightly prefer the taste I had yesterday - both probably should rate about a 4.25. Caldera is more bitter - that isn't a bad thing - and has a noticeably dryer finish. Body is on the light side of medium - seems slightly thinner than Dale's - while carbonation is crisp and appropriate. Final verdict?

I noticed no oxidation whatsoever. It poured a just-slightly-hazy golden body beneath a short head of frothy white foam. The head dwindled down to a creamy surface covering, and then shrank away to a wide collar and whispy surface covering; leaving behind tiny-spotted walls of lace. Bright hops, sweetish malt, and yeasty fruitiness greeted me in the nose, expressing soft citrus, sweetish grainy malt, berries, and cut-grass. It's soft carbonation and medium-light body left it remarkably smooth across the palate. The flavor delivered a rich maltiness upfront that wasn't quite caramelish or toasty, but headed there; followed by an influx of grassy and citrusy hop flavors; and then some berry-like fruitiness at the swallow. The bitterness roses up strong, and although some sticky malt lingered in the mouth, it was bitter, dry, grassy and spicy in the finish. It lingered momentarily with some strength, and then faded to a dull bitterness, leaving me ready for another sip. Quite the little charmer, I say! I love the flavor transition from quaint, sweetish, straight-forward and non-caramelish maltiness, to bold, grassy, citrusy, and bitter hops!!!

Juicy aroma for sure. Flavor doesn't live up to the nose. The malts to back up the hop flavors are lacking, so this ends up being very dry. Decent hop bitterness, but not a very distinctive hop character. Lacks the roundness of some of the better pales. Mouth is decent, pretty light with some brightness, but with enough body.

The attractive, cream colored head looks to be high in hop oils; at least I hope so. The glass residue is so fine and spider web-like that it resembles actual lace. Drinking this beer out of the can and missing an appearance like this should be a criminal offense. The nose is outstanding (see 'drinking... can... criminal offense' above) and puts a huge number of IPAs to shame. The pithy pungency of the Cascade hops fairly leaps out of the glass, with the overall aroma made deeper and more interesting by a much lesser quantity of spicy Perle hops. Great job Caldera. Even if the flavor is on the pedestrian side, the nose is a world-class sprinter. The flavor doesn't measure up to those stratospheric heights, but that's not to say this isn't a deliciously hoppy pale ale. Emphasis on hoppy. The brewers made sure their beer would last a good, long while by packaging it in light-rejecting aluminum and by adding an impressive amount of hops. Sweet, spicy and juicy white grapefruit is front, center and back. I love the slight variation on the usual Pacific NW flavor profile that the German hops provide. APAs don't need to be complex to suit me (this one isn't), they just need to be bursting with pale malt-supported bitter hoppiness (this one is). There's enough sweetness on hand to keep things kinda, sorta balanced from a hophead's perspective, although the pucker factor is still decidedly high. The mouthfeel is light-medium and perfectly carbonated; the better to down a few cans on a hot summer day without a second thought. Caldera Brewing Company is anything but a household name (unless one lives in Ashland, Oregon or its environs), but this little brewery has just provided me with the best beer that I've ever had out of a can.

Nice deep color for a pale ale. S: Light aromas of citrus and floral hops with bready and caramel malts. I'm also getting aromas of something similar to yogurt, sort of that lactic sour smell. T: Biscuity malt, almost lightly nutty, with floral and grapefruit flavored hops mixing in well. The hops are present but never push the malt flavor out. Bitter-sweet aftertaste. M/O: Crisp, refreshing, highly drinkable. It's hoppy enough to more than please for a PA and light enough to keep it easy on the palate. Light-medium body with good carbonation. Without a doubt one of the best pale ales I've had.",1315501843
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,4,4,4.5,cbarrett4,4,"Poured from can (love it!) into Deschutes Becker style pint glass. Pours true pale ale hue, straw core, light head fading to pretty decent clinging lace. Smells of hops, though of a more subtle style, some malts, and a hint of the yeast. Kind of fresh and inviting. Tastes of pale ale malts, some good hops, nicely green yet subtle. Texture is spot on, great balance, superb finish. This beer really starts shining once you swallow the sip. Overall a good Pale Ale, and one that deserves a mention among Mirror Pond, Full Sail, and Lompoc. I can't really think of any pale ale that is really much better.",1315424611
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,3.5,4,4,chodinheaven,4,"Orange-yellow in color with perfect clarity and a big foamy white head on top. Excellent retention and lacing. Estery and fruity on the nose, soft citrus mainly. Oranges or tangerines. Light citrus and pine hops as well. Well balanced in the taste. Citrus and pine hops dominate the taste buds, but balance themselves out nicely to create a drinkable and hoppy pale ale. The bitterness comes on at first like its going to be overdone, but then backs down just at the right moment to make for a very nice sipping experience. Tangerines definitely make their way into the taste as well, not tangy at all, just sweet and estery. Easy to drink and heavy enough for the hopheads, yet soft enough for every one else. Long dry finish, hoppy til the bitter end, leaving a nicely pleasant bitter aftertaste. Decent beer, no complaints here for trying it.",1313814599
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,Beerandraiderfan,4,"Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.",1313539369
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4.5,3.5,4,4,MrVonzipper,4,"Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.",1313538701
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,witster18,4,"Good pale ale. Out of a can is a novelty. Made this and a few others a great choice for craft beer golfing fare. Tastes great. Lots of grapefruit and pine notes, but it's the stoutish chocolate backbone that makes this a real winner. Far more earthy than some other, more popular pale's out of bottles nonetheless. Very tasty. Will definately revisit. Drawbacks... not many... a little sour in the finish when the choco and malt dissapates.... could also be the can talking here... but regardless this is one dam^ fine pale ale. a little pricey around here at 10.99/six doesn't help either... sure it's less near the source.... will take it for another round soon.",1313344297
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),3.5,3.5,4,4.5,jeff1973,4,"12oz can poured into a pint glass. A - Clear copper/orange with eggshell head that left a little lacing. S - Slightly nutty, floral hops, a little malt sweetness. T - A nutty/slightly sweet richness that fades into citrus/floral bitterness. M - Medium/Light, silky. D - High, the silky mouthfeel is not only adds to the taste, but also makes this go down real easy. Very nice, everyday drinking beer. Could give Mirror Pond a run for my ""fridge beer""",1313205214
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,4,4,3.5,Duff27,4.5,"A- Aggressive pour yields a three inch off white head. Beer itself is a somewhat cloudy dull light orange. Awesome head retention with above average lacing. S- Bright citrus notes...think lemons, oranges. T- Follows the nose. With a noticeable, but not overpowering, dose of hops on the back end. Well balanced. Alcoholic orange juice, mmmph. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is lacking a bit it seems. D/O- One of the better pale ales I've had in awhile. Drinkability is the tits...and in cans no less! First Caldera offering is a winner in my book.",1312859109
5.5,25414,1075,Caldera Pale Ale,American Pale Ale (APA),4,3,3,4,Phelps,3,"Poured into a small snifter. Slightly hazed and the color of sunshine, with a honking cream-colored head of froth that drops slowly, leaving film in big walls on the glass. Snappy nose. Grass, lemon lemongrass! Also get biscuits, honey, a tiny bit of cracker malt and hints of earth. The flavor improves on the noses maltiness with biscuits and a pale cracker finish. The bitterness is a bit too light I get some lemon peel and maybe some German spice as well, but I could use more hops. The finish is cleanly malty, and I get a flash of uncooked malt at the swallow almost like a handful of dry pilsner malt. Medium-light body with very light massaging carb and soft fizziness. Clean, light and drinkable great for a hot day. Calderas pale ale would be great on the golf course. Its flavorful yet sessionable. More hops would help bump this one up to the next level.",1311635079
